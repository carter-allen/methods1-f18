## Introduction to Biostatistics

Methods 1 is an introductory course to biostatistics, a field that deals with the application of statistical methods and theories to the life sciences. Biostatistics seeks to formalize and quantify the scientific method by providing tools that allow for _inductive reasoning_. In contrast to _deductive reasoning_, where specific inferences are drawn from a more general theorem, inductive reasoning relies on observations (data) to arrive at more general theorems. With statistics, we can use data to better understand a given process, generate hypotheses regarding that process in general, and test the validity of our hypotheses against what we observed.
